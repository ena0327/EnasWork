 ***me killing danille***

**Narrator:** It was a gloomy day with a grey sky and dark clouds.
As Danielle is walking on a mysteriaus path.
**Narrator:** As **I** was trailing behind her. 
*deuh duh duh Scary music starts playing*
Danille starts to feel like something is watching her as her path home feels like forever and the day starts to turn to night.
As I still trail behind her finding evry little hinding spot to stay out of her sight.
Danille clueless as can be Sings baby shark. 
*music switches to baby shark and Danielle doing a jolly walk*
*and back to I the narrator of this story and the scary music returns*
Danielle pulls out a box of chicken nugges during her walk and starts eating them UNTILL........
I jump out and eat her last chicken nuggie
She then screams and has a heart attack. 
she dies right there
but as i looked down at her I pulled out some kimchi and she was resurected out of the blue and steals my kimchi. 
*THE END!*
